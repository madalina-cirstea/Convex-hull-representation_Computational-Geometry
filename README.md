### Requirement
Given a convex polygon and a point outside it, find the convex hull of all the points.

### How does the algorithm work?
- Sort the points of the polygon in trigonometric sense.
- Find the polygon's closest point to the external point.
- The points are traversed in trigonometric sense to find the upper edge.
- The points are traversed in trigonometric sense to find the lower edge.
- In the new set of points we add the outer point, the upper edge, the lower edge and the points between them in the trigonometric sense.

### How to run the program?
- Create a session.
- Add the points of the polygon.
- Add the the external point.
- Draw the polygon.
- Click Play
